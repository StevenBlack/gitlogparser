More readme fixes. More readme refinements. More readme shenanegans. More readme tweaks. Remove commented code. Split everything into git and MacJournal modules. Test for the semver tag detector.

Move git module functionality to main.rs. Refactor types and traits. Small reorg of the readme. Start roughing-in a basic config file named .timesheet.
2021-12-10 Don't need these tests. Fix test. New function commasand(), to be used for consolidated enumeration. Playing with structopt. Rename common.rs to utils.rs. Run everything through shared settings now.
