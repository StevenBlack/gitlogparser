# ðŸ•‘ `git log` and MacJournal export parser

A personal project, written in rust.

**WORK IN PROGRESS; NOT READY**

This repo consolidates daily activity from two different sources and produces one consolidated line per day.

## Background

When I track project time and tasks, I use `git log` reports, and ad-hoc daily notes kept in (the most excellent) [MacJournal](https://danschimpf.com/). I merge these two sources to create one spreadsheet cell per day.

This is a tedious manual process.

### Raw output from `git log`

The `git` command looks like this...

```
git log --pretty="format:%cd %s" --since="60 days ago" --date="short" >> "gitoutput.txt"
```
... which produces output like this:

```
2021-12-01 0.13.6
2021-12-01 Issue #2971 and #2951: assessing the sorry-ass state of our data pipeline.
2021-12-01 Issue #3341: check the weekend schedule, why is there is no Saturday schedule this week.
2021-12-01 Issue #404: fix â€” promote the Job screen to the main menu, and rename it "Upcoming Jobs".
2021-12-01 Issue curation.
2021-12-01 Afternoon coordination meeting with QA.
2021-12-01 Issue 405: refactor â€” reorganise this long query to make it easier to deconstruct.
2021-12-01 After hours â€” update test/dev data.
```

## What I need

All the above input consolidated on one line per day that looks like this:

```
2021-12-01 Version 0.10.27 built, tested, and rolled out. After hours ... etc...
```

## Details

The following refinements (should) apply:

### Git tags (status: ðŸŸ¢)

Lines with raw git tags look like this: "`0.13.6`".

They should become the sentence "`Version 0.13.6 built, texted, and rolled out.`"

### Remove trivial commits (status: ðŸŸ¢)

Commits that say trivial things like "`Fix whitespace`" or just "`Whitespace`", or "`Fix typo`" or just "`Typo`", or the latin "[`Ibid.`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibid.)", are dropped.

### Repeated issue references (status: ðŸŸ¢)

Repeated commits referring to the same issue, originally this....
```
Issue #3138: fix â€” thing one.
Issue #3138: fix â€” thing two.
Issue #3138: fix â€” thing three.
```

... become (note the semicolon `;` delimiter and the period `.` at the end.)

```
Issue #3138: fix â€” thing one; fix â€” thing two; fix â€” thing three.
```

### Repeated version references (status: ðŸŸ¢)

Handwritten version number commits lke ...
```
2021-12-01 Something version 0.3.11
2021-12-01 Something version 0.3.12
2021-12-01 Something version 0.3.13
```
... become (note the semicolon `,` except with `and` as the last delimiter, and the period `.` at the end.)

```
Issue #3138: Something version 0.3.11, 0.3.12, and 0.3.13 built, tested, and rolled out.
```
